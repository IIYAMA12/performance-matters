### Compress images
To speed up the content, all images are re-compressed for the web. The default image compressors within for example Photoshop do not compress to this level by default. You can do it in Photoshop ofcourse, but you need to have some advanced knowlegde about everything related to images. In Photoshop you can for example reduce the amount of colors, but that is only helpful depending on the end format. 

Tools online like Tinypng can do this automatic for you.
